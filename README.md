# The path to instability in multi-planetary systems

This repository contains the source code to reproduce the figures from Petit et al. (2020). The figure notebooks can be run directly from the csv files in the repo.

There are also python modules containing the function used to compute the survival time of any system, the main function being in survivaltime.py. The amdcrit module contains functions allowing to compute the critical AMD for a pair of planet.
